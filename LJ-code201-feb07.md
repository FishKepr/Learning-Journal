<ul>
<li>Very tired today.  I was up until 1:30 AM last night doing a reading assignment and was up at 6:00 to go to work. </li>
<li>Developers at work drafted again into working on the mysterious production issue and it's impacting the release related projects.  Architects said this morning they will try to shield ADM from further requests from the client on this as they are sure it is not an application problem.</li>
<li>Struggled assimilating the reading assignment on CANVAS and CHART.js, but that may have been due to the late hour.  Did not have time to revise notes prior to deadline. Definitly not up to what I usually write up.</li>
<li>Got a perfect score on Quiz 4.  I thought I encountered a trick question but it really was not.  Once again it pays to verify answers even if you think you know them.</li>
<li>Can't find a partner for Chocolate Pizza.  Seriously?  Not sure what to make of that.  What did I do?</li>
<li>Planning to attend a Meetup next Tuesday to meet career assignment requirements.  Funny how these assignments intimidate me more than anything else.</li>
<li>Still trying to figure out the CodePen site.  Need some procedures for it.  Worst case I understand that we can submit the wire-frame lab via GitHib.</li>
<li>UPDATE 4:00PM:  Found a partner for Chocolate Pizza.  "Yay."  Hmmm.  It's the new incoming student so maybe it's because she doesn't know me yet.</li>

<h1>Learning Journal Feb 07</h1>
<ul>
<li>Very tired today.  I was up until 1:30 AM last night doing a reading assignment and was up at 6:00 to go to work.</li>
<li>Struggled assimilating the reading assignment on CANVAS and CHART.js, but that may have been due to the late hour.  Did not have time to revise notes prior to deadline. Definitly not up to what I usually write up.</li>
<li>Got a perfect score on Quiz 4.  I thought I encountered a trick question but it really was not.  Once again it pays to verify answers even if you think you know them.</li>
<li>Can't find a partner for Chocolate Pizza.  Seriously?  Not sure what to make of that.  What did I do?</li>
<li>Planning to attend a Meetup next Tuesday to meet career assignment requirements.  These assignments intimidate me more than anything else.</li>
<li>Requested TA regrading on several reading assignments.</li>

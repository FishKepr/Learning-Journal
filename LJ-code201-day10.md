<li>Rachel is correct in that this is a collaborative class.  I often observe students striving to help each other.</li>  
<li>The creative side is starting to appear in the curriculum.  It will be interesting to see how well I adapt, but I must admit some apprehension.</li>
<li>Mastering Git is proving more challenging than expected.  The concepts are very different from SCLM and I'm having trouble adapting for some reason, not sure why.  The TAs are helpful in that aspect, but itâ€™s still a bit discouraging, especially with the lab assignment on Git coming up.  I think more diagrams would help.</li>

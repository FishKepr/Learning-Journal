<li>Busmall was really fun.</li>
<li>It's worth noting that one of the most enjoyable aspects of the past few days was the level of collaboration among the students.  Across all levels, everyone was helping each other and it felt like a real team effort.</li>
<li>Confused by one thing though:  I was graded an 8 on Busmall because I suposedly 'neglect[ed]' the HTML and CSS.  That was odd because I checked with the students around us and we all agreed that it was strictly a functional exercise with no appearance requirements.</li>
<li>Holie is fun to work with.  Never know what to expect with her mood swings and the needs of her conditions so she keeps us on our toes.</li>
<li>ADM manager again expressed some displeasure about my taking this course.  Don't know how this will play out.</li>

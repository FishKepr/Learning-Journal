<li>Busmall was really fun.</li>
<li>It's worth noting that one of the most enjoyable aspects of the past few days was the high level of collaboration among the students.  Across all levels, everyone was helping each other and it felt like a real team effort.</li>
<li>Confused by one thing though:  I was graded an 8 on Busmall because I supposedly 'neglect[ed] the HTML and CSS'.  That seemed odd because I checked with the students around us and we all agreed that it was strictly a functional exercise with no appearance requirements.  It will be interesting to see what the others got.</li>
<li>Hollie is entertaining to work with.  I never know what to expect with her mood swings and the needs of her condition so she keeps us on our toes.</li>
<li>AD manager again expressed some displeasure about my taking this course.  Don't know how this will play out.</li>
<li>In watching the class code demo, it's interesting how much more DRY Rachel's code is.  In looking at my version, it looks structured like a COBOL program.  Is that a bad thing?  To me it's more readable.</li>

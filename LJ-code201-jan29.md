<li>Lab 7 was harder than it should have been, mostly because when I moved a block of code, I accidentally dropped a critical HTML element.  I was a bit frustrating because I had it working and then it stopped.  I kept thinking 'If I fix this it will work again' and spent way too much time finding that.</li>  
<li>Getting Lab 7 done felt like a real accomplishment even thought it's a asthetic trainwreck.</li>
<li>Took most of Sunday off to get personal things done such as Federal taxes.  However I'm paying for that as I'm behind on reading now.</li>
<li>David Johnson asked me to be his 'accountability partne'.  Curiously on of the requirements is that it must me someone that we need to be 'less casual' with.  That may be a problem as pretty much the entire class is rather casual.</li>

<ul>
<li>Doing well on JavaScript and OK on CSS, but falling behind on Career Development assignments.</li>
<li>Missed an opportunity to network with other PMs, ironically because I was working at CF on a lab assignment.  This would have qualified as one of the Career assignments, but I did not know that at the time</li>
<li>Held one-on-one with Rachael.  It was very encouraging actually.  I relayed my concerns that my department manager has about my attending this course, but she have me a few ideas for what to say to him.</li>  
<li>Rachael also gave a vew valuable suggestions as to how I can fulfill the Networking assignments with other students.</li>
<li>Met with TA Chris and we clarified a few observations he had while grading my assignments.</li>
<li>Found a second accountability partner.</li>
<li>On a side note:  At work, I attended a hour long meeting on deciding new color schemes for our internal web based application.  It was fascinating as there was NO real method other than trial and error.  One wall was was covered with color palletes.  Lots of "How does this look?" or "Let's try that."</li>

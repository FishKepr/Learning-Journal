<h1>Learning Journal Mar 28</h1>
<ul>
<li>Spend the first part of the Wednesday lab going over the code from the Tuesday lecture.  Was able to understand it much better this time around.</li>
<li>New partner is Autumn!  We are proceeding a bit slower than with Josh but that was mostly because we ran into some mysterious bugs.  The frustrating thing about the one that really held us up is that we solved it using trial and error and could not figure out the difference between what worked and what did not.  The code logically the same.</li>
<li>Not wearing the finger splint any more and my typing improved dramatically.</li>

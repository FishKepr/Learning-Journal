<h1>Learning Journal Day 3</h1>
<h2>Today I remembered or learned:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Keep your mouth shut unless necessary.  Let the instructor do her job.</li>
<li>Don’t try to type along.  Just follow what the instructor is doing and take in all in.  Download the lecture code later.</li>
<li>Create the directory on Github, not on the client.</li>
<li>Always check what’s in a directory before deleting it, not matter how much of a hurry you are!</li>
<li>Slow is smooth.  Smooth is fast.  Fast mistakes takes longer than slow correct steps.</li>
</ul>

<p>Git Upload steps:<p>
<ol>
<li>git status</li>
<li>git add .</li>
<li>git commit -m 'Third upload of Journal entry'</li>
<li>git push</li>

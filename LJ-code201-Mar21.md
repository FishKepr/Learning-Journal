<h1>Learning Journal Mar 21</h1>
<ul>
<li>Last week's exercises with Michael went very well, even though I discovered afterwards that we missed something.  He was an excellent partner to work with.</li>
<li>Deanna is now addicted to poke salad thanks to Ana.  It is incredibly good for an $11 meal.</li>
<li>I have to manage time more effectively this week as last week seemed frantic, but I think the more stable calendar should help with that.</li>

<li>Last week's exercises with Michael went very well, even though I discovered afterwards that we missed something.  He was an excellent partner to work with.</li>
<li>Deanna is now addicted to poke salad thanks to Ana.  It is incredibly good for an $11 meal.</li>
<li>I have to manage time more effectively this week as last week seemed frantic, but I think the more stable calendar should help with that.</li>
<li>Rachael talked about how great the latest placment stats were back in 201, but CF had not posted them yet when I last checked.  Not sure what to make of that, but I overheard in the break area two graduates talking about how they could not find jobs because they did not have degrees. Hope that does not tie into the stats not being released yet.</li>
<li>Started exercises with new partner Josh, who on the surface seems pretty sharp.  This was an interesting dynamic.  It took me a bit longer to 'click' with Josh, but once we did, we moved very fast, faster than any other combination I've had before.</li>

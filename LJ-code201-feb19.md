<ul>
<li>Completed the Code 301 Entrance exam today.  Despite a few issues it went well and I scored 88% per the application, but Rachel said that she would adjust that</li>
<li>I must say that it's a bit of a relief knowing the test is behind us.  Not sure why that made me so nervous. </li>
<li>We found out that there there will be more labs before we can start on final projects.  This was a b it of a rude shock as we thought that Busmall was the last one.  Hopefully we can get them done quickly.  The Team was not happy about this.</li>

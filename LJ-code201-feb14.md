<li>Attended my first Meetup last night: 'Targeting Your Career Change into Web Development ' It was sponsored by Seattle University as part of an effort to promote their Web Development programs.  That was very interesting and far more enjoyable thean expected.  It was interesting to hear the perspective from another school.  Took lots of notes and sipped my first beer in probably 20 years.</li>
<li>One of the more interesting points from the Meetup discussion was how important fundamentals is, meaning HTML, CSS and JS.</li>
<li>Rachel commented on Monday that about us being tired, presumably from the workload.  I receintly did some tracking and I now consume 3-4 cups of coffee a day, up from 1 or perhaps 2 on a heavy day.</li>
<li>Resubmitted Busmall with some CSS added per the TAs suggestions.  I really need to get more comfortable with CSS.  Also resubmitted a few others to get back some points missed for quickly correctable issues.</li>
<li>I had planned to take Quiz 5 today during lunch but something hot came up.  Will do it tomorrow or Friday so it's a good thing quizzes don't get marked off for that.</li>
<li>Today's reading assignment was one of the most interesting ones yet: An article on a 3 year study regarding team building at Google.  I was so impressed I forwarded it to the contract team leads and managers at work.</li>
<li>Hollie withdrew for health reasons.  We shall miss her.  Sent her a Slack message.</li>
<li>Joined the 'Find your Spike' project group.  Definitly looking forward t working with this team.</li>

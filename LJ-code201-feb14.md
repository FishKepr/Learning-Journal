<li>Attended my first Meetup last night.  That was very interesting and far more enjoyable thean expected.  It was interesting to hear the perspective from another school.</li>
<li>One of the more interesting points from the discussion was how important fundamentals is, meaning HTML, CSS and JS.</li>
<li>Rachel commented on Monday that about us being tired, presumably from the workload.  I receintly did some tracking and I now consume 3-4 cups of coffee a day, up from 1 or perhaps 2 on a heavy day.</li>
<li>Resubmitted Busmall with some CSS added.  I really need to get more comfortable with CSS.</li>

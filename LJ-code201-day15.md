<h1>Learning Journal Jan 24 (Day 15)</h1>
<ul>
<li>Yes, as predicted at the start of class, I'm starting to hit a bit of a wall at week 3.  Not so much with the class, but my boss noticed that my attention toward my team is slipping and that I'm missing things.  Not good.</li>  
<li>Grade slipped to the mid-80s due to a few missed points and and absence, but also because the Resume assignment was graded early.  We thought it was due this week so I submitted the Resume assignment, but when it was postponed, those who submitted it early was given a zero.  I also missed replying on a few reading assignments which also results in a zero even if you submit your primary content on time.  Ouch.</li>
<li>This is our first assignment where our creativity will be graded!</li>
<li>This is also our first assignment with a tangiable application and so far its a lot more fun.</li>

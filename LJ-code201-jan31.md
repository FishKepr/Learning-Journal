<h1>Learning Journal Jan 31</h1>
<ul>
<li>Monday's commute was the worst yet because of a car fire on I-5.  GPS helped bypass it.  Curiously, the next day was the smoothest.</li>
<li>Lab 7 (Salmon Cookies) has not been graded yet so I have not moved on to the form portion (Lab 8) yet.  In a way, this is OK since I was able to catch up on reading.</li>  
<li>First draft of LinkedIn profile completed too.  It was late but won't be penalized at such</li>
<li>Got a perfect score on Quiz 3 on the first try. "Yay." NOTE:  It helps to check answers even when you think you know them.</li>
<li>Need to find a second accountability partner.  Someone asked me but I need to confirm.</li>
